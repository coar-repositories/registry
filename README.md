# International Registry of Open Access Repositories
Collaboration space for the design and development of an international registry of repository systems.

Currently, we are collecting user stories, using the format:

`As a <stakeholder>, I want <some goal> so that <I get some benefit>`

by adding them as "issues" in this Github repository.

To add a user story:

1. [Create a new issue](https://github.com/coar-repositories/registry/issues/new), using the following format for the title of the issue
2. Before you save your issue, tag it with the "user-story" label.
3. That's it!

We will be recording the process of processing the user stories on the [User Story Analysis project board](https://github.com/coar-repositories/registry/projects/1)

Have a look at the other user-stories and feel free to comment on them!
